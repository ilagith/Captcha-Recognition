# Captcha-Recognition

### Introduction 
This project is divided into 2 tasks:  

a) Train two models to recognize handwritten English letters and compare their performances;  
b) Use the best trained classifier in the first task to identify which letters compose a corrupted image (captcha)

### Dataset

*Task a):*  
It consists of images of handwritten English alphabet and the corresponding labels. In total 124800 images and labels are present. 
For each label 4800 different images are available.

*Task b):*  
It is composed of a series of 4 letters in a corrupted image of size 30 × 140. No test set was provided.

### Methodology

*Task a)*  
K-NN was utilized as a baseline and compared with the classification accuracy of a 2-D CNN.

*Task b)*  
First, noise was removed from captcha. Then, bounding boxes were used to divide the image into 4 letters. 
Hence, predictions were made per each letter. 

### Results 

*Task a)*  
| *Accuracy Score(%)*| Validation set  | Test set |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **K-NN**  | 82.9% | 84.8%  |
| **CNN** | 95.01% | 95.4%  |
